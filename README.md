## Final Project - Ohio Valley Antique Mall

Remake of the ohiovalleyantiques.com website.

Goal of the website is to make the navigation simpler and less cluttered, while also updating the design to match the store's logo.

I'm a second year student in the Applied Media Communications program, and I'll be transitioning over to main campus by the end of April. My main interest is in videography, but I've been interested in web design since I started college. I do a lot of writing in my free time, and I got a kitten in January named Evie!
